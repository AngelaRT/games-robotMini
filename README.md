# games-robotMini
My TFM (Master in Robotics) code:

There exist two different games in this repository: cardsGame (kind of memory game, the aim is to find all the cards pairs) and differencesGame (the typical "find the N differences"!). Both have been built with a similar architecture. There is an user interface which lays over HTML, js, CSS code. And, there is a backend. As this takes part of a robotics master, there is no other way of building the backend but using ROS.
